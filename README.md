Description
-----------


UniVRse is a interactive planetarium using the museum's partyview data and making it accesible to anyone with a smartphone, computer or virtual reality headset.This web platform allows a "Teacher" to run through a lesson with a classroom in the stars with each individual joining the classroom from their remote device. The "Teacher" decides where the classroom travels in space and allows them to learn about the location, celestial or planetary. This allows for accesibility of the awesomeness of Hayden Planetarium for those who do not have the priveledge of living close to the museum. Also, this creates a user friendly and inexpensive way for students to engage with the milky way in an immersive and ineractive manner, sparking interest in astronomy.  

The mobile application is paired with digital universe api to filter a selection of information on the fly, allowing for an indivifual to sample a focused view of for instance:exoplants, dwarf galaxies, or star clusters.  

There are several main ways in which this could be used:  

1. The ability to download planetarium shows onto a mobile device or google cardboard allows any user to browse and archive of 
	planetarium shows toexplore the universe in their own flight  

2. The accesibility of the 3d environment from mobile devices could be developed to allow student at a distance to watch guided 		planetarium shows guided by staff in realtime.   

3. Create a potentially interactive exhibit at the museum using virtual reality devices to prove supplemental activities for 
	visitors of the museum and allow them to fly around the stars.
